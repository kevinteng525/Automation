SourceOne is a dynamic document archiving solution targeted to large enterprises as well as SMB. However, it lacks the ability to track and audit the product configuration changes as well as audit searches and retrieval actions by the administrator to meet data control requirements by the organizations. Another functionality that’s not available is general reporting which is critical for any archiving system. A general reporting functionality would allow the user to view the operational functioning in terms of day-to-day performance and over different period of times,  system usage in terms of archive, resources, chargeback, content etc. and compliance reporting with audit reports, system process reporting, folder security changes etc.
